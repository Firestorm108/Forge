<h1>Summary</h1>
A rigid, reliable CNC router that has a main function of milling PCBs. Its 775 spindle motor serves this function well, however it can also perform other tasks such as cutting softer materials and engraving metals.

The first day! I researched extensively about CNC routers and mills, as well as their functions. Turns out there are a lot of parts to a CNC router. First, I decided whether to use a moving gantry or a moving bed. In this case, I opted for the moving bed due to its higher rigidity. And so, I got to work researching the basic parts such as the 24V power supply, the brushless fan for cooling, the SKR mini v3 board, a Genmitsu 775 spindle motor, and the 2004s1 stepper motors. I was thinking of adding a screen or a small control panel later on after the minimal viable product was complete. Other hardware parts included the linear rails, lead screws, extrusions, filament type, bed type, and thumbscrews. I decided to go with a 200mmx200mm bed size as that would be plenty for PCBs and it would also stay quite compact.

After that, I started working on the CAD. I added the 2020 aluminum extrusions and made a joiner plate. The extrusions were 200mm long and I went with them over the 2040s due to the rigidity increase probably being overkill as well as it getting significantly bigger. I also realized that I would need an M5 tap to be able to join the extrusions well which is fun.
