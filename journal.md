<h1>Summary</h1>
A rigid, reliable PCB router that can mill copper clad. Its 775 spindle motor serves this function well, however it can also perform other tasks such as cutting softer materials and engraving metals if necessary.

The first day! I researched extensively about CNC routers and mills, as well as their functions because a CNC router is the basis for a PCB router. Turns out there are a lot of parts to a CNC router. First, I decided whether to use a moving gantry or a moving bed. In this case, I opted for the moving bed due to its higher rigidity. And so, I got to work researching the basic parts such as the 24V power supply, the brushless fan for cooling, the SKR mini v3 board, a Genmitsu 775 spindle motor, and the 2004s1 stepper motors. I was thinking of adding a screen or a small control panel later on after the minimal viable product was complete. Other hardware parts included the linear rails, lead screws, extrusions, filament type, bed type, and thumbscrews. I decided to go with a 200mmx200mm bed size as that would be plenty for PCBs and it would also stay quite compact.

After that, I started working on the CAD. I added the 2020 aluminum extrusions and made a joiner plate. The extrusions were 200mm long and I went with them over the 2040s due to the rigidity increase probably being overkill as well as it getting significantly bigger. I also realized that I would need an M5 tap to be able to join the extrusions well which is fun.

HUGE amounts of work were put into the CAD and overall design today!!!
I finished almost the entire Y axis. All that's needed left is the mount for the stepper motor and the bed itself!
Overall I'm really proud of how clean and sturdy it looks right now and how much progress I got done.

The entire Y-axis was finished today!!! I thought this finishing part would be easy, but I had to make a few adjustments to get it to fit together nicely. First, I replaced the upper 3d printed parts with extrusions to make it stronger. I then made the stepper motor mount (and made it level with the ground so there would be zero flex, and rigidity would increase). After that, I polished up the whole thing to fit a bit better and added corner brackets and moved things around a bit. Finally, I finished up by making the bed which has M6 threads spread out evenly so I can use a thumbscrew clamp system to hold down the PCB being machined no matter the size.
