# Meet Forge

Forge is a mini CNC mill that is capable of milling metals such as aluminum, brass, and copper. It fires on all pistons, with an all-steel/aluminum build (not a single 3D-printed part!), ultra-rigid build, 500W BLDC spindle, high-torque NEMA 23 steper motors, a 20mm thick aluminum fixture plate, ballscrews, linear rails, and limit switches!

The machine aims to push the boundaries of at-home milling, from copper-clad FR4 to thick pieces of aluminum. 

I designed Forge due to my constant draw towards new materials that I've always wanted to use in projects. Stuff like plexiglass, metals, and wood! I wanted to expand my material selection further by adding aesthetic, cheap, and structural materials. As well as this, I wanted a precise machine that I designed myself, to be powerful, useful, and sleek.
