# Forge

Forge is a mini CNC mill that is capable of milling metals such as aluminum, brass, and copper. It fires on all pistons, with an all-steel/aluminum build (not a single 3D-printed part!), ultra-rigid build, 500W BLDC spindle, high-torque NEMA 23 steper motors, ballscrews, linear rails, and limit switches!

The machine aims to push the boundaries of at-home milling, from copper-clad FR4 to thick pieces of aluminum.
